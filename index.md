Title: The role of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases on neural stem cell differentiation    
  
Abstract  
Oxidoreductases plays the vital roles in all aspects of cell biology. Here, we examined the 
role of Grx2, a glutathione-dependent enzyme catalysing the reversible S
deglutathionylation of various key proteins implicated in cellular metabolism, signal 
transduction, gene expression and cell motility, in differentiation of neural stem cells and 
oligodendrocyte progenitors. By using neuronal-OPC co-cultures we show that genetically 
mediated Grx2 deletion in NG2+ oligodendroglial lineage leads to substantial decrease in 
generation of MBP-expressing myelinating cells. Increase in the total number of Olig2+ 
cells (mature and oligodendrocyte precursors) in mutant cells rules out the cell toxic 
effect of Grx2 deficiency on lineage survival and may argue for stage specific role of Grx2 
required for proper myelin synthesis and, hypothetically, for establishment of myelin 
sheath. Analysis of mitochondrial activity in Grx2-/- stem/progenitor cells revealed a 
drastic decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). In line with this, 
supplementation of growth media with recGrx2 enhanced MMP of cultured cells. The later 
effect was not associated with changes in generation of mitochondrial superoxide under 
basal conditions or upon NMDA-induced stimulation of NG2+ OPCs, as suggested by 
measurements with mitosox sensor dye. Results of present study expand our previous 
observation that in vitro differentiation of NG2+ immature OPCs is under control of Grx2 
activity. Taking into account that various steps of oligodendroglial differentiation and 
particularly the synthesis of lipid-rich myelin proteins are primarily dependent from the 
mitochondrial ATP production as well as mitochondria-generated metabolic 
intermediates (e.g. carbone bones, acetyl-CoA), these results may point to a novel 
mechanism by which primary-mitochondria specific oxidoreductase, Grx2, supports 
energetic and metabolic demands of myelinating cells in the CNS.

Title: Characterization of FRET-based sensors of interfacial macromolecular crowding  
  
Abstract  
Cells provide a highly crowded environment in which the excluded volume effect affects 
equilibria like protein folding and stability. This is barley probed on the cell surface which 
shows a highly dense packed space with membrane proteins. In this thesis Förster’s resonance 
energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors are presented to investigate crowding on the cell 
surface. Liposomes and Nanodiscs were used to mimic the cell membrane and crowding 
agents like polyethylene glycerol (PEG) and streptavidin A1D3 simulated crowding. Whereas 
synthetic membranes were either cowered by PEG or bound by A1D3. By creating a crowding 
sensing protein, cellular processes like translocation can be further analyzed and understood. 
We find that the sensors are affected by crowding in an unbound state but not when bound 
to the synthetic membrane via SecE-SpyCatcher. Different methods of preparing sensor bound 
membranes showed first insights to the complexity of probing interfacial macromolecular 
crowding.
