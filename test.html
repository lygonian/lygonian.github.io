<p>This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis and prediction model for a bank marketing campaign dataset. The key steps include data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), RFM segmentation, and machine learning model training and evaluation. The final model, a <code>BalancedRandomForestClassifier</code>, achieved a significant improvement in predicting customer subscriptions to term deposits, with a notable F2-score of 0.70 (increased from 0.30).

<p>Here a summarizing dash app which lets you filter between Customer Segments.</p>

The final model achieved a significant improvement in predicting customer subscriptions to term deposits.  </h2>
<h1 id="goal">Goal</h1>
<p>Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.  </p>
<p>Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.</p>
<p>The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).</p>
